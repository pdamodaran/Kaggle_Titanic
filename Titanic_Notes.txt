Titanic Notes


to use random forests, try running a pairs plot first to see how the classes are distributed across the different variables.  use that to run a classification model to train the data

run models using all the variables, then remove a variable to see if the classification is better.  if it is worse, it is likely the variable is important for classification

look at permutations of pairs of variables to train a classification model

look at professor's randomForests.r script for finding outliers


1) Take a random sample of the training data
2) Plot the data to see where the survived and non survived fall (will need to convert categorical variables to numeric variables

Look at partialPlot function in random forest to see if it will be helpful to figure out the classification

review recursive partitioning in prof lecture


Training set 

Age, embarked, and cabin have missing values
pClass - first class, second class, third class
embarked - place the passenger embarked from: Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton

Test Set - Age, fare, cabin have missing values

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
survival        Survival
                (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
pclass          Passenger Class
                (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
name            Name
sex             Sex
age             Age
sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
ticket          Ticket Number
fare            Passenger Fare
cabin           Cabin
embarked        Port of Embarkation
                (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

SPECIAL NOTES:
Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
 If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
for sibsp and parch.

Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
the definitions do not support such relations.


It appears that some people booked multiple cabins (separated by space)
